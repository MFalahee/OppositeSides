Hi!

This is a small project, that I'm currently working on. 
Inspired by my daydreams as a kid. Not sure where it's headed totally, but I'll update this as it plots a course.
Hopefully by the end of it, I'll have something that's made with many mistakes, a will to learn, and some fun too.
If you have comments or want to contribute to the project, please contact me!

### Currently built with:

# [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript): Language built on top of JS that adds a whole new ballgame with types that basically long story short helps with errors and debugging. I think. I've only used it for two days at the time of writing this.
# [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react): React? I know of it, yeah. I use it.
# [React-DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom): ^ I had a good buddy named Dom once, nice guy.
# Google Maps [React-Wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@googlemaps/react-wrapper): Wrapper and Status components that allow smooth rendering of a Google Map react component
# [SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass): Styling styling styling - ain't nobody got time for vanilla css
# [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): Used for HTTP requests to local backend API key storage for now
# [fast-equals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-equals): allows for fast equality comparisons on two objects (Google made me)
