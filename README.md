### Hi!

This is a small project, that I'm currently working on. <br>
Inspired by my daydreams as a kid. Not sure where it's headed totally, but I'll update this as it plots a course. <br>
Hopefully by the end of it, I'll have something that's made with many mistakes, a will to learn, and some fun too.  <br>
